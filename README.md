Summary of Exploratory Findings
- The most common gender is male then female and other is a little number of users.
- Subscriber user are most common in the data more than customers.
- The most common ages are between 20 and 40 years.
- The trip durations are below 200 minutes and age is below 60. the more Age increase the duration is slightly decreased. I expect the more age increase the duration will be highly decrease.
-Other have the higher duration trips then females then males, the duration increased significantly for all gender types in Sunday and Saturday.
- I found there is no thing noticed about gender change along day time in both customer and subscriber. in subscriber the most trips at 8, 9 ,17, 18 o'clock.
- the count of rides for subscribers is decreased Significantly in the weekend days (sat, sun) and for the customer there's no significantly increase or decrease of trips expected in Thursday the trip count increased for both types of users.
- So, I think subscriber users use the bike to go colleague or work.
